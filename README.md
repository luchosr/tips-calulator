# Tips and Bill Calculator

## Description and Motivation

- This project allows you to calculate the bill amount of your order and tip percentage. It was created to practice TypeScript and improve my coding skills using React.js, the Context API, and TailwindCSS. You can select the different options in the menu and then calculate the tip amount to pay.

- I used React.js for its simplicity and component-oriented capabilities with TypeScript to avoid type-related errors at compile time and ship safe code, and TailwindCSS to apply styles because it's a very fast way to apply styles in your code.

## How to Install and Run the Project

- You can clone the repo, make a cd into the project folder and then run `pnpm install` for installing the dependencies, then you can run `pnpm dev` and the project will start on development mode.
